 * Chessboard.js library
 * 
 * ⚠️ WARNING: This is a PLACEHOLDER file. The visual chessboard display in the GUI will NOT work without the actual library.
 * 
 * To make this extension work fully, download the actual chessboard.js library:
 * 
 * Primary source:
 * https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sayfpack13/chess-analysis-bot/main/tampermonkey%20script/content/chessboard.js
 * 
 * Alternative source (official):
 * https://github.com/oakmac/chessboardjs/releases
 * 
 * Instructions:
 * 1. Download the chessboard.js file from one of the URLs above
 * 2. Replace this entire file with the downloaded content
 * 3. Reload the extension in chrome://extensions/
 * 
 * The chessboard.js library is used to display a visual representation of the
 * chess position in the extension's GUI popup.
 * 
 * Note: The extension's core functionality (move analysis and highlighting on the board)
 * will still work without this file - only the separate GUI window display is affected.
